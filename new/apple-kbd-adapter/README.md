# Apple 2 keyboard adapter for Apple 1 computer
This is a simple adapter to connect an Apple 2 compatible keyboard to an Apple 1
computer. The pinouts were obtained from the article [Using an Apple II Keyboard
with an Apple 1
Computer][http://randomvariations.com/2014/10/16/using-an-apple-ii-keyboard-with-an-apple-1-computer/]
at [Randomvariations.com][https://randomvariations.com].

There are similar adapter boards for sale through various sources. This design
based only on the referenced article. Any similarities to alternative adapters
is coincidental and due solely to the simplicity of the design, and obvious
requirements such as the desire for reset and clear buttons mounted on the board
and remotely.
